# I2P_Crawler
A simple python script that crawls the i2p network logging every functioning destination, as well as stores all .onion and clearweb links along the way.

I2P Daemon must be running on default 127.0.0.1:4444
Clearweb links are left unexplored for anonymity and are just added to the list.


This script is very slow and rather primitive.
